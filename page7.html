<br> <br>
<b>Payment Terms and Appointment of Sky Flicker as Limited Payment Collection</b>

As set forth above, except where we otherwise specifically agree in writing, Sky Flicker does not own, create, sell, offer, resell, provide, control, manage, buy, offer to buy, bring, or offer to bring or supply any Sky Flicker Items/ services or any other tangible or intangible thing that You may discuss with another Member. When wisher and Travelers make or accept an offer to transact, they are entering into a contract with each other, and even though Sky Flicker may act as a limited payment collection agent as defined below, it is not a party to any agreement discussed or entered into between Members.
<br> <br>
Sky Flicker may restrict the availability of payment services, or any aspect or feature of payment services, to perform maintenance of systems to help ensure the proper functioning of the system or to improve, enhance, modify, suspend or terminate any payment service, or to introduce new or additional services at any time, including through additional third parties. The payment-related services may contain links to certain third-party websites, applications, services or resources (“Third Party Services”). Any such Third Party Services are subject to different terms or conditions and privacy practices created or controlled by third party providers and not Sky Flicker, and Members should review them carefully and independently. Sky Flicker is not responsible for or liable for the availability, accuracy, reliability or anything related to Third Party Services, including the content thereon. Links or other access to information of Third Party Service providers shall not constitute an endorsement by Sky Flicker of such providers or their services.
<br> <br>
<b>Appointment of Sky Flicker Payment Collection</b>
<br> <br>
By agreeing to these Terms, and in accessing or using the Sky Flicker Platform, Travelers appoint Sky Flicker as their respective limited payment collection agent, authorized to receive and collect payments for transactions entered into between Members, including (i) Item Costs, (ii) Sky Flicker Service Fees, (iii) Traveler’s Fees, (iv) Acceleration Fees, if any, and (iv) Taxes and other Government Regulatory Fees (for example, without limitation duties, tariffs or government charges) (“Total Fees”) owed by Wisher to Travelers as set forth in these Terms. Payments made by Wisher (Aladdin) to Sky Flicker in connection with an Offer shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to Travelers, and Travelers agree to provide the Sky Flicker Items to Wisher in the agreed-upon manner as if the Traveler has received payment directly from Wisher. You further agree that Sky Flicker obligation to remit payments to Travelers is conditioned upon and extends only to sums that it has successfully received from Wisher in accordance with the relevant agreements, and also that in accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent, Sky Flicker assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of Wisher or Travelers, Members or any other person. As limited payment collection agent, Sky Flicker assumes no liability or obligation for any funds or obligations owed by Wisher that were not collected by Sky Flicker in its role under this Paragraph.
<br> <br>
Each Wisher (Aladdin) and Traveler acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that Sky Flicker is not a party to the agreement between Travelers and Wisher, Sky Flicker acts as the Travelers payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting collection from Wisher on behalf of the Traveler. Upon Wisher’ remittance to Sky Flicker, Wisher’ payment obligation to the Traveler for agreed upon amounts is extinguished, and Sky Flicker is responsible for remitting funds collected to Travelers in the agreed upon manner. In the event that Sky Flicker does not remit such amounts, Travelers’ recourse is only against Sky Flicker, and not Wisher directly.
<br> <br>
If any Member does not make a payment properly, or if Sky Flicker cannot properly charge a payment method on file with it, or any other payment method for any reason, Sky Flicker expressly reserves all rights under applicable law to recover payment as well as all of its costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys’ or other professionals’ fees, in pursuing such payment (s).
<br> <br>
<b>Transactions between Wisher (Aladdin) and Travelers on Sky Flicker</b>
<br> <br>
Sky Flicker strives to make the Sky Flicker Platform useful, simple and efficient. Sky Flicker Wisher (Aladdin)s located globally may gain access to friends who have better availability to Sky Flicker Items in other markets who may be fully willing to bring these items to their Sky Flicker friends and colleagues. At the same time, Sky Flicker enables Travelers to help their friends and community, and may even help them defray the time and expense of their travel to see and help their global Sky Flicker friends. Through the Sky Flicker Platform, Sky Flicker helps to bring diverse groups of people together, and hopefully, to minimize the differences and divisions that can accumulate over time, geographical distance and cultures.
<br> <br>
As set forth more fully below, in a typical transaction facilitated on the Sky Flicker Platform, the Wisher (Aladdin) publishes an invitation called a “Wisher (Aladdin) Request” which identifies desired Sky Flicker Items. Interested Travelers or Travelers matched by the Sky Flicker Platform, may then make offers to bring Sky Flicker Items on terms expressed between Members in a “Traveler’s Offer.” When agreed upon, execution of the “Wisher (Aladdin)’ Acceptance, fixes the final and binding agreement between the Members.
<br> <br>
<b>The Wisher (Aladdin) Request</b>
<br> <br>
After finding an Item of interest, Wisher (Aladdin)s must create a valid Wisher (Aladdin)’ Request. The Wisher (Aladdin) Request is made when the Wisher (Aladdin) uses the Sky Flicker Platform submission tool to (i) describe the item specifically including the price; (ii) to add the location (City and Country) where the Wisher (Aladdin) is or where they want the Sky Flicker Items brought, and (iii) to add the desired receipt date. Sky Flicker advises Wisher (Aladdin) to be as specific as possible, and provides a place to “Include a Note to Your Traveler” to help ensure that a Traveler obtains and brings only the desired item. Wisher (Aladdin) shall not request Prohibited Sky Flicker Items.

<br> <br>
Sky Flicker recommends that Wisher (Aladdin) and Travelers (Jinn) consult their respective government agencies which regulate items that may and may not be brought into or out of a country of origin.
<br> <br>
<b>Suggested Traveler Fees</b>
<br> <br>
When the Wisher (Aladdin) creates a Wisher Request, the Sky Flicker Platform may auto-calculate a suggested, optimal Traveler Fee, for illustrative purposes in planning the Wisher transaction. As explained below in the section “Fees,” the actual Traveler Fee on any given transaction is set entirely by the Traveler and may be more than, or less than the suggested Traveler Fee.
<br> <br>
<b>The Travelers Offer</b>
<br> <br>
To assist Members to locate and communicate with each other, including potentially dates upon which Members can meet in person, The Sky Flicker Platform allows Travelers to enter the details of upcoming travel dates, and to browse published Wisher (Aladdin) Requests made by their Sky Flicker friends. Travelers can indicate their preference to be notified of upcoming Wisher (Aladdin) Requests that may correspond to their planned trips, or trips that they may be willing to take.
<br> <br>
Upon finding a suitable Wisher (Aladdin) Request, Traveler must submit a “Traveler’s Offer”. The Traveler’s Offer must contain and describe each component of the Total Fees:
<br> <br>
<b>Fees</b>
<br> <br>
The following components that make up the Total Fees must be contained in, and fully described in the Traveler’s Offer. When Accepted, the Traveler’s Offer establishes the final and total amounts to which the Wisher (Aladdin) agrees to share profit & Sky Flicker will take 20% on profit share from Wisher.
<br> <br>
(i) Sky Flicker Item Cost: Although a Wisher (Aladdin) may specify a price in the Request, the actual Sky Flicker Item Cost shall be the amount specified by the Traveler in the Offer;
<br> <br>
(ii) Service Fee: This is as service fee charged by and retained by Sky Flicker for the use of its Sky Flicker Platform by Wisher (Aladdin) and Travelers. Service Fees are collected by Sky Flicker from Wisher (Aladdin)s and deducted from remaining amounts remitted to Travelers by Sky Flicker as the Traveler’s limited payment collection agent as described above. Service Fees are non-refundable.
<br> <br>
(iii) Traveler’s Fee: The Traveler’s Fee is the amount Wisher (Aladdin) agree to give to their Traveler friends for helping the Wisher (Aladdin). As set forth above, Sky Flicker may estimate a Traveler’s Fee for planning purposes, but the actual Traveler’s Fee is set by the Traveler in the Offer. The Service Fee and Traveler’s Fee may collectively be referred to by Sky Flicker as the “Platform Fees).”
<br> <br>
(iv) Acceleration Fee: The Expedited Fee, if any, may be added to Sky Flicker Items with the consent of both Wisher (Aladdin) and Traveler to accelerate the time in which Travelers may obtain and bring Sky Flicker Items.
<br> <br>
(v) Applicable Taxes: Sky Flicker may auto-calculate an estimate of sales and other taxes associated with the Traveler’s Offer. Sky Flicker always separately states the Applicable Taxes from the Item Cost, and the Platform Fees.
<br> <br>
(vi) All government fees, tariffs and duties are the responsibility of the Traveler and Traveler is required to make sure that the Wisher (Aladdin) is aware of such fees prior to accepting the offer.
<br> <br>
<b>Wisher (Aladdin) Acceptance</b>
<br> <br>
When the Wisher (Aladdin) and Traveler have agreed to all aspects, including applicable timing and Total Fees, the Wisher (Aladdin) must agree to the Traveler’s Offer, in what we call the “Wisher (Aladdin) Acceptance.” The Wisher (Aladdin) Acceptance is a agreement on all material terms between a Wisher (Aladdin) and Traveler, under which they agree to be bound to each other to in the manner agreed.
<br> <br>
<b>Acceptance of Sky Flicker Items</b>
<br> <br>
The Wisher (Aladdin) and Travelers must agree at the time the Wisher (Aladdin) Request is accepted by the Traveler on a specific time period for acceptance of the Sky Flicker items. Travelers shall bear the responsibility to identify an acceptable safe and public place to meet with their Wisher (Aladdin) for the purpose of inspection and exchange of goods. The time for delivery can be extended only by written agreement between the Wisher (Aladdin) and Traveler on the Sky Flicker Platform, or by Sky Flicker. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, it is the Wisher (Aladdin) obligation to inspect and accept the Sky Flicker items at the time of delivery, and the agreement between the parties is deemed complete at the time of acceptance regardless of whether the Wisher (Aladdin) shows up to inspect and accept Sky Flicker items. Unless the Traveler and Wisher (Aladdin) have agreed otherwise in writing, if the goods are not made available for delivery and acceptance within five (5) days of the delivery date, and the Wisher (Aladdin) has not inspected and accepted the Sky Flicker Items, the Wisher (Aladdin) Payment Method will be charged and the amounts released to the Traveler. The only permissible method to extend the delivery, inspection and acceptance periods agreed to by the Wisher (Aladdin) and Traveler is written communication between the parties on the Sky Flicker Platform or through notification by Sky Flicker through the Sky Flicker Platform.
<br> <br>
<b>Instant Possession</b>
<br> <br>
In Sky Flicker sole discretion, it may offer Wisher (Aladdin) and Travelers the option to request, pay for and perform an “Instant Possession” where Members can agree to all relevant terms up front without negotiation. With Instant Possession, when enabled, the Wisher (Aladdin) Requests Sky Flicker Items, and agrees that his or her chosen payment method will be charged for the full amount of Total Fees upon the Traveler’s Acceptance. With Instant Possession, the Wisher (Aladdin), and not the Traveler, establishes or confirms all components of the Total Fees at the time of the Wisher (Aladdin) Offer, including the Item Cost, the Service Fee, the Traveler’s Fee, the Acceleration Fee (if applicable), the Applicable Taxes. All Total Fees are established when the Wisher (Aladdin) makes the offer and the Wisher (Aladdin) payment method is charged at the time of the Traveler’s acceptance.
<br> <br>
Travelers who wish to perform an Instant Possession can select one or more Instant Possessions that correspond to their chosen or preferred travel, and agree that they will receive only the amounts specified in the Wisher (Aladdin) Instant Possession Offer. For example, a Traveler accepting an Instant Possession will not be able to adjust the Item Cost or the suggested Traveler Fees when an Instant Possession is accepted by the Traveler. Wisher (Aladdin) remain responsible at all times for paying the Total Fees, including the non-refundable Service Fee, as specified in the Instant Possession.
<br> <br>
Sky Flicker may offer alternative options for the timing and manner of payment for Sky Flicker Items, in its sole discretion.

If S<br> <br>ky Flicker is unable to collect any amounts due from Wisher (Aladdin) under these Terms via the chosen payment method, Wisher (Aladdin) authorize Sky Flicker to charge any other payment method on file with Sky Flicker (unless any have been previously removed or the authorization to charge them has been previously rescinded). Wisher (Aladdin) also expressly authorize Sky Flicker to recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting any Total Fees not paid or collected via your chosen payment method that remain due and owing. Sky Flicker is not responsible for any fees or charges that a third party payment processor may impose when payment methods are charged or disputed, and disclaims all such liability.

          <br>
         In case of Pre-ordered products, a full refund can be given after the seller refuses to confirm the order. Travelers can take his product money from our office or bank account & digital wallet. We will hold the payment of both parties until they confirm goods. Wishers have to pay full amount of product value. When we get confirmation from the wisher, then we release money to the traveler bank account.
 <br>
            <br>
Wisher (Aladdin) may refuse to accept the Sky Flicker items only if the Traveler has brought incorrect goods (for example, specifications which differ from the agreement between the parties, in terms of brand, color, style, size, etc.) or the condition of the Possession’s items is other than that agreed to between the parties (for example, damaged or used items or otherwise not in the condition represented). Wisher (Aladdin) may not refuse acceptance of Sky Flicker items because they changed their mind about the transaction, or through an attempt to renegotiate the price of the items or because they have found the items elsewhere. Wisher (Aladdin) agree that Sky Flicker, in its sole discretion, may determine whether the reason for rejection is acceptable under applicable policies and if Sky Flicker determines the rejection is impermissible or unauthorized, Wisher (Aladdin) agree that their Payment Method may be charge and the transaction completed as agreed to by the parties. Except as set forth above, in instances where the Wisher (Aladdin) fails to appear for inspection and acceptance within five (5) days of the delivery date, Wisher (Aladdin)s are required to confirm inspection and acceptance of Sky Flicker items in the Sky Flicker messaging on the Platform in order to release funds to Travelers.
